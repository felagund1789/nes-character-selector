# NES Classic Character Selector

A simple web app built with React and styled using [NES.css](https://github.com/nostalgic-css/NES.css) to give it a nostalgic NES look and feel. This app allows users to select their favorite NES character from a list and displays a short description along with the games in which the character appears.
